## Architecture

```
User → Frontend (React) → ICP Backend Canister → Claude API → AI Response
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [DFX](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- Claude API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ichetanmittal/askicpagent.git
   cd askicpagent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd src/askicp_frontend
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

3. **Configure Claude API Key**
   
   Edit `src/askicp_backend/main.mo` and replace `YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Claude API key:
   ```motoko
   let claude_api_key = "sk-ant-api03-your-actual-api-key-here";
   ```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
